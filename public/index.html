<h1>Task Monitoring System</h1>
<p>
    This is task monitoring backend for interview test from <a href="https://www.xcidic.com/">XCIDIC</a>, so basically i
    just split
    the project into two versions which is Backend version & Frontend version,
    and this one is the backend version, the frontend version itself will be splatted into two versions which is the
    Angular version and ReactJS version, as i mentioned on the phone call that i am not familiar with ReactJS, instead i
    used Angular and Vue JS
    but of course i can do React JS if it supposed to be, but take time between 1 or 2 weeks before it ready to work
    with real project, so this project is a test for the interview, and the duration is no longer than a week, so i
    decided to write a two version of Frontend system,
    and the Angular is the primary tool for the Frontend.
